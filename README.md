Agricultural insurance anomaly detection using Isolation forests

## Fire conditions:
In the presence of dry vegetation.

Lightning: For spontaneous veld fires, lightning is usually the source of ignition.

Low relative humidity: Low relative humidity results in more fast and furious fires.

Wind speed: High wind speeds and gusts cause fires to spread faster.

High temperature: A hot dry environment is very conducive for fires and create an opportunity for high heat concentration to occur causing ignition.

## Hail conditions:
Low temperature: Cold air draft cools rain droplets and results in the formation of hailstones.

Rainfall: Hail usually comes coupled with heavy rainfall.

Wind speed: Cold wind gusts cool droplets into hail, the speed of wind also affects the speed that the hailstones will fall. High speed hail is more detrimental than that travelling at low speed.

High relative humidity: The presence of water droplets in very humid air, means that they could freeze and coagulate and forming hail.

These perils will be explored and analysed to get insight their occurrence.
